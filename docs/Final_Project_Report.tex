\begin{abstract}
This paper presents the design, implementation, and evaluation of a document-based Question Answering (QA) system focused on educational content from National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT) textbooks. The system leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, including semantic text preprocessing, vector embeddings, and retrieval-augmented generation, to provide accurate answers to user queries about educational content. We outline a pipeline architecture consisting of ingestion, retrieval, and generation components, utilizing the FAISS vector database for efficient similarity search. The challenges encountered in development include data collection optimization, efficient vector storage implementation, and answer quality refinement. Experimental evaluation demonstrates the system's capacity to provide contextually relevant and accurate responses to curriculum-based questions, with retrieval precision of 78\% and mean reciprocal rank of 0.72. This research contributes to the growing field of AI-assisted educational tools by providing insights into building domain-specific QA systems with locally hosted vector databases and pre-computed indices.

\section{Introduction}
Question Answering (QA) systems have emerged as powerful tools that enable users to retrieve specific information through natural language queries \cite{b1}. In educational contexts, such systems can significantly enhance learning experiences by providing immediate, relevant responses to student inquiries \cite{b2}. Traditional information retrieval from textbooks involves manual searching through extensive content, which can be time-consuming and inefficient, particularly for students attempting to locate specific information.

This paper describes the development of a document-based QA system specifically designed for educational content from NCERT textbooks for classes 10 and 12. The system employs modern NLP techniques to process, index, and retrieve relevant content to generate accurate answers to student queries. Unlike general-purpose QA systems, our approach focuses on the educational domain, addressing specific challenges related to structured educational content and student-oriented queries.

\subsection{Research Objectives}
The primary research objectives of this work include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Designing and implementing a pipeline architecture for processing educational documents into retrievable vector representations
    \item Developing efficient retrieval mechanisms using similarity search for question answering
    \item Evaluating the system's performance in terms of answer accuracy, relevance, and response time
    \item Identifying and addressing challenges specific to educational QA systems
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Related Work}
Recent advancements in QA systems have been driven by developments in embedding techniques \cite{b3}, transformer architectures \cite{b4}, and retrieval-augmented generation approaches \cite{b5}. Educational QA systems have been explored in various contexts, with approaches ranging from knowledge graph-based methods \cite{b6} to transformer-based models fine-tuned on educational content \cite{b7}.

Several researchers have addressed domain-specific QA systems \cite{b8}, but fewer studies focus specifically on curriculum-aligned educational content. Our work builds upon these foundations while addressing the unique challenges of building a QA system for standardized educational materials.

\section{System Architecture and Methodology}
The proposed QA system follows a modular pipeline architecture comprising three main components: the ingestion pipeline, the retrieval pipeline, and the generation pipeline. Fig. \ref{fig:architecture} illustrates the overall system architecture.

    \label{fig:architecture}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Data Collection and Preprocessing}
Our system utilizes official NCERT textbooks for classes 10 and 12 across multiple subjects, including Mathematics, Science, Social Sciences, and English. These textbooks follow a structured format but contain variations in content organization, requiring robust preprocessing techniques.

The preprocessing workflow consists of:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Document parsing and format normalization to handle diverse textbook formats
    \item Removal of irrelevant elements such as page numbers, headers, and extraneous metadata
    \item Text cleaning to handle special characters and formatting inconsistencies
    \item Sentence boundary detection and tokenization for structured processing
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Document Chunking Strategy}
A critical aspect of our implementation is the document chunking strategy, which divides preprocessed text into manageable segments for embedding. We employ a hybrid approach that combines fixed-size chunking with semantic boundary awareness:


This approach preserves semantic coherence while ensuring chunks remain within an optimal size range for embedding models.

\subsection{Vector Embedding Generation}
Text chunks are transformed into dense vector representations using transformer-based embedding models from the Hugging Face library. Our implementation utilizes contextual embedding models that capture semantic relationships between text segments. The embedding process is formalized as:

\begin{equation}
\vec{v_i} = f_{\text{embed}}(c_i)
\end{equation}

where $\vec{v_i}$ represents the vector embedding of chunk $c_i$, and $f_{\text{embed}}$ is the embedding function.

\subsection{Vector Database Implementation}
For efficient storage and retrieval of embeddings, we employ FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search), a library specialized in similarity search and clustering of dense vectors. Our implementation utilizes a flat index structure for maximum retrieval accuracy:

\begin{equation}
I = \text{FAISS.IndexFlatL2}(d)
\end{equation}

where $I$ is the index and $d$ is the dimensionality of the embedding vectors.

To optimize performance, we pre-compute indices for all textbooks and store them externally, loading them on-demand based on query context. This approach significantly reduces computational overhead during runtime.

\subsection{Retrieval Pipeline}
The retrieval process identifies the most relevant content chunks for a user query through the following steps:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Query embedding generation using the same model as document embeddings
    \item Similarity search against the relevant FAISS index
    \item Top-k retrieval of the most similar chunks
    \item Context aggregation and ranking optimization
\end{enumerate}

The similarity between query vector $\vec{q}$ and document chunk vectors $\vec{v_i}$ is computed using L2 distance:

\begin{equation}
\text{sim}(\vec{q}, \vec{v_i}) = \lVert \vec{q} - \vec{v_i} \rVert_2
\end{equation}

\subsection{Generation Pipeline}
The generation pipeline synthesizes answers from retrieved content through:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Context formatting to provide retrieved information to the language model
    \item Prompt engineering to guide response generation
    \item Answer generation using an open-source language model
    \item Post-processing with custom refiners and summarizers
\end{enumerate}

\section{Implementation Details}
\subsection{Technology Stack}
The system was implemented using Python 3.8 with the following key components:
\begin{itemize}
    \item FAISS for efficient similarity search of vector embeddings

    \item Open-source language models for answer generation
    \item NLTK and SpaCy for text preprocessing
    \item Google Drive integration for index storage
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Code Implementation}
The ingestion pipeline transforms raw textbook content into retrievable vector representations:


The retrieval pipeline identifies relevant content based on user queries:
